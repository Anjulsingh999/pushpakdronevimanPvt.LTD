Historically, ground measurements were used, but now aircraft like planes and helicopters, equipped with diverse sensors, including temperature, capture data. However, aircraft operations are costly and require skilled operators. Mapping drones offer a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative. They autonomously capture high-quality images, ensuring efficient data collection."
